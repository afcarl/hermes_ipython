This repository contains the ipython notebooks and examples for Silburt et al. (2016).

The current list of notebooks are:
1) HERMES_Error_Characterization_Theory.ipynb - This notebook calculates the error Hamiltonian for the HERMES integrator in 2D using Democratic Heliocentric Coordinates.

2) HERMES_Error_Characterization_Simulation.ipynb - This notebook uses the theoretical predictions from 1) and compares it to N-body simulations.

3) HERMES_Kirsh.ipynb - This notebook displays the code used to reproduce the Kirsh example in Silburt et al. (2016).
